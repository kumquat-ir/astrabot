# astrabot
A Discord bot that I made mainly to use [textboxer](https://github.com/kumquat-ir/textboxer)

Currently just does textboxer-related stuff

## Requirements
Python 3.10  
discord.py (it's back!)  
Pillow (for textboxer)

Full textboxer resource directory at `tb-resources`  
`config.json`, use `config-example.json` as reference

## textboxer interface
`a> tb oneshot shepherd My rams clock at 1333 megaherds.`
